## initial release

This library was extracted from the [coffeescripted-sbt](https://github.com/softprops/coffeescripted-sbt) sbt plugin for standalone use and abuse.

Basic usage is simply

    coffeehaus.Compile(coffeeSrc).fold(handleError, jsSrc)

See the [readme](https://github.com/softprops/coffeehaus/#readme) for more common usage examples.

## Features

- compiles [vanilla coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
- compiles [iced coffeescript](http://maxtaco.github.io/coffee-script/)

### Non-Features

- A lack of a out of the box async interface. This release targets scala versions supporting `scala.concurrent.Future`, which 
makes it trivial to make the async choice yourself. Batteries are now included in the language so they are intentially kept out
of the library.
